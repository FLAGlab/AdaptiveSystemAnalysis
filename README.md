# AdaptiveSystemAnalysis

This repository contains the implementation of our framework for the analysis of COP/Adaptive systems.

## Analyses

The focus of the repository is on the algorithm to calculate the points-to sets for COP programs using the the Context Traits JavaScript language extension.
The analysis is an extension on the existing WALA framework to account for the COP language abstractions.

**Note**
The repository presents at the moment the examples uses for the evaluations. Further examples, and the full implementations will be released soon.
