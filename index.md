## Points-to Analysis for Context-Oriented JavaScript Programs

This online appendix presents the complete evaluation results for our work on points-to analysis for Context-oriented Programming JavaScript programs, in the specific case of the Context Traits language.

Currently we evaluate the precision, recall and performance of four COP programs extracted from the literature. The evaluation compares three analyses: (1) the WALA analysis (used as a _baseline_), (2) the analysis of the _whole program_ (including external libraries) using the baseline, and (3) _our_ proposed analysis.
